While President Trump sported a more traditional black-and-white tuxedo, FLOTUS stood out with a pale yellow chiffon gown from French label J. Mendel. The off-shoulder dress featured a wrapped bodice, floor-length pleats and a billowing cape that gave her a dramatic, yet delicate look.

Melania paired the ensemble with minimal jewelry and sky-high stiletto heels in a matching pastel color.

The $6,990 ready-to-wear dress has been so admired that it is completely sold out on J. Mendel‚Äôs website ‚Äì though the price was dropped to $2,996, USA Today reported.

After Melania debuted the gown, several took to Twitter to gush about the outfit, even comparing the first last to a Disney princess.

While the dress seemed to be a big hit with most, some were not as complimentary of the buttery yellow frock.

Sorry but as pretty as it is Melania's yellow dress is WAAY too formal for a dinner dress. Looks like she's going to a royal wedding or a presidential prom. #melaniasdress

I knew Melania's awful dress reminded me of someone. How apt! #BeautyAndTheBeast #TrumpUKVisit https://t.co/Hov2EbpivN

Melania's dress looks ridiculous and old fashioned.

The Trumps are joining Prime Minister May and other British business leaders at the black-tie dinner at the palace to kick off their visit to Britain.
