Firefighters in California work to rescue a man who is stuck in a large hopper of dry cement.

Firefighters in California on Thursday night rescued a man after he became trapped in a cement mixer for hours.

A supervisor at U.S. Pipe in Union City was looking into a concrete hopper silo when he lost his balance and fell into it, a worker told Fox 2 KTVU.

The Alameda County Fire Department said first responders performed a "technical rescue" to pull the man out of the hopper.

The man was finally rescued roughly two hours later, around 6:45 p.m. local time.
