Amazon Prime Day is upon us, and while the sale doesn't officially begin until 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET, Amazon is kicking things off early with a few sales on its own devices. Check those out below to get a head start on your Prime Day shopping.

You'll need to be a Prime member to get the best bargains. If you're not already a subscriber, it's free to join for 30 days, after which it's $119 per year.
