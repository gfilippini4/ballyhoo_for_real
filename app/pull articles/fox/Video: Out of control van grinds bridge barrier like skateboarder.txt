Video of an out of control van in the U.K. grinding the road barrier like a skateboarder.

This video shows the see-it-to-believe-it moment when a van driver dices with death by grinding along the edge of a road bridge.

The extraordinary footage of the white van going within inches of falling onto the dual highway below was captured in Burton-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, U.K.

It shows the van being forced to grind along the road rail, Tony Hawk-style, and then the edge of the bridge itself by a car in the inside lane, which appears to make a late break for the A38 slip road.

The footage was filmed by driving instructor Ian Stinchcombe, whose student was on her test at the time.

"The car was on a test with a female student driving, and an examiner in the passenger seat," Stinchcombe said.

"The girl saw it in the mirror and was in tears when they got back to the test center."

Amazingly, the student still managed to pass her exam despite the incredible goings-on behind her.
