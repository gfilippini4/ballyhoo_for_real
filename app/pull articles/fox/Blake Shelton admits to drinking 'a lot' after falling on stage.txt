A video posted by a fan of Blake Shelton falling on stage forced the country music star to respond on his twitter, admitting that he has been drinking 'a lot.'

Perhaps Blake Shelton had too much "Sangria."

The country singer admitted drinking "a lot" after a fan posted a video of Shelton stumbling and falling down on stage during a show in Pendleton, Ore., on Saturday night.

The country singer laughed off the incident on Twitter.

"Ok Pendleton I know somebody is bound to have video of me falling on stage last night!! Please!! I have to see it!!! Post that s--t! And yes I had been drinking. A lot," Shelton joked.

In the video, Shelton can be seen tripping over something on stage before taking a tumble. He quickly gets himself back up and continues on with the show.

While Shelton is OK joking about his drinking habits now, the country singer wasn't happy when In Touch published a cover story where the tabloid labeled him as a drunk in need of rehab.

Shelton and the magazine settled the suit in April 2017, two years after the tabloid declared on its September 2015 cover Shelton had hit "rock bottom" after his divorce from Miranda Lambert and included several anecdotes of the singer's alleged drunken antics.
