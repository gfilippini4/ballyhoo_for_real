Bon Appétit has definitively answered a question that many may not know needed answering.

Early Monday morning, rapper Post Malone asked Twitter, “is meatball an fruit?”

is meatball an fruit

'PAPA JOHN' SCHNATTER CLAIMS HE WAS ‘PUSHED’ TO USE N-WORD

Since the Grammy-nominated musician tweeted out the question at 1:38 am, more than 1,600 people have commented and nearly 25,000 have retweeted the inquiry as of Monday afternoon.

Some confirmed to Malone that meatballs were fruit.

From a full blooded Italian . Yes

yes

MEaTball is not exactly fruit but I’d say YES if there’s Tomato Sauce because tomato is a fruit

Others merely took time to ask if other foods could be classified as something else, and show concern for the rapper’s state of mind.

Sorry, Post Malone, eating meatballs won’t count towards your daily recommended two servings of fruit. Though pizza may count towards your vegetable intake.
