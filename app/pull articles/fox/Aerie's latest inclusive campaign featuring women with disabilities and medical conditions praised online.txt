Aerie is being praised for its latest campaign featuring a diverse range of real and unretouched models, including those in wheelchairs, with crutches, insulin pumps, hearing aids, vitiligo, Down syndrome, fibromyalgia, cancer and more.

American Eagle’s lingerie and intimate apparel brand has long been an advocate for inclusive marketing and its newest advertisements are even more so.

"As a brand, Aerie has been a leader in empowering women and celebrating inclusivity and body positivity since our launch of #AerieREAL in 2014," Jennifer Foyle, Aerie Global Brand President, told Fashionista. "Our newest bra models are part of our brand's ongoing commitment to show real, authentic and unretouched women, who are at the core of everything that we do."

Called "Aerie Bras Make You Feel Real Good," the company found women for the campaign by holding an open casting over social media where thousands of women responded with videos about why they should be included, Fashionista reports.

“You may have seen some new faces at Aerie.com this week. They’re YOU!” Aerie tweeted on Wednesday. “You sent your videos, shared your stories & came together to create something real. More you. More love. More coming soon.”

The images have been well-received online, with people applauding the company for showcasing women who are normally underrepresented in fashion ads.

Can we just take a second to applaud @Aerie for expanding their #aeriereal campaign to include even more body types! I have never seen a model I could relate to, and honestly buying clothes is constantly questioning whether I can wear this with my pump. pic.twitter.com/rfkXqPpwmq

I’m tearing up at this thread. 👇🏼😭 @Aerie made the decision years ago to never use airbrushed models, and now these wonderful photos. Representation matters. Showing girls of all shapes, sizes, ages, colors and conditions helps us all feel beautiful in our own skin. https://t.co/0x49QKDhkt

THIS 🙌🏼🙌🏼 Aerie is giving me and all other Type One Diabetics the confidence to wear our “robot parts” without ever thinking it makes me any less beautiful #aerieREAL 💗 pic.twitter.com/jmBi000Uf9

Y’all, Aerie launched their new line with SO many diverse models! People of all races, ages and abilities are represented (and that’s just what is visible!!) Each model is so different from the next and they all look so beautiful! There’s even a model with body hair! #AerieReal pic.twitter.com/zbhbUkRBdU

I'm impressed! First time I've ever seen a model showing off her #InsulinPump while showcasing underwear. Brilliant, @Aerie. #AerieReal just like me! Thank you.⚡️ “Fashion retailer Aerie celebrates inclusivity in new campaign”https://t.co/GQOamcYe7F

Obsessed with the fact that @Aerie is showcasing models of all backgrounds, shapes, sizes, and lifestyles. Officially always purchasing from there 🙌🏼 #AerieReal

This is amazing, and this used to be me.

Two years ago I had my colon removed and a temporary ostomy put in. I’m so happy to see a model proudly and beautifully represented like this! This #aerieReal inclusivity campaign is the best. @GutlessGlamour you look amazing! pic.twitter.com/NzFzzeW1Mq

Just when you didn’t think @Aerie could be any more #aeriereal, they put REAL customers as their models; no matter their size, ethnicity, age, etc. 😍 I love you Aerie

Another major fashion retailer, ASOS, was praised earlier this month for selling disability-friendly clothing with an ad featuring a model in a wheelchair.

While the company didn’t go to the same extent that Aerie did with inclusive advertising, it’s a step in the right direction.
