Police in England pulled over a car last week with a flat tire that was also missing a front fender, but were shocked to discover it had a bucket seat.

Not an actual bucket seat, but an overturned bucket being used by the driver as a seat.

As if that weren’t bad enough, the steering wheel of the Peugeot 206 compact was missing and there was a locking pliers in in its place.

The King’s Lynn authorities don’t seem to have been impressed by the fact that the driver was able to operate the manual transmission-equipped vehicle in this condition and tweeted that he was with “too many offenses to mention.”

Yes this was driven on a road and yes he was sitting on a bucket and steering with a pair of mole grips. Driver will be reported for too many offences to mention! #KingsLynn #WestARV @RPFOUSgt #Unbelievable #1383/652 pic.twitter.com/2Sg8uYhtSt

DUI wasn’t one of them, as the driver passed an alcohol and drugs test.

However, police said the car’s registration expired in 2015 and that it was seized and sent to the scrap yard.
