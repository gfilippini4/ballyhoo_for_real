Amazon Prime Day is finally here. This year offers even more opportunities for savings than ever, as shoppers now have a full 36 hours to cash in on member-exclusive savings across departments including tech, home, fashion, beauty, lifestyle, sporting goods and more. Starting on July 16 at 3 p.m., Amazon Prime members can score Black Friday-like markdowns on hundreds of products.

To help you navigate this massive sale, we've created this handy interactive guide. Top products are broken down by category, including home, outdoors, tech and Amazon devices.

And if you're looking for some extra stellar markdowns, we have a curated "Best Deals" section, just for you. We want to help you spend less time searching for the items you want and more time shopping. After all, time is of the essence here!

Remember, to actually unlock these savings you'll need an Amazon Prime account. So grab a membership here (if you don't already have one) and shop these stellar products now, before Prime Day is over.
