Although building credit can sometimes be difficult, secured credit cards are an excellent way for people to do so! They work by using a refundable security deposit to open up an initial line of credit. Take a look at the Discover it® Secured and the Capital One® Secured Mastercard®.

By: Maggie Criss Milhorn | Jun 2, 2018

While I agree that sometimes you do have to start with a secured card and build your way up. I have found that the cards that seem to give you a chance with lower credit are: 1) Capital Platinum Card. Both of my sons have been approved for this card, as well as Credit One. They are low balance and very high interest cards, but if you are looking to do small charges and pay it off every month then these are two possibilities.
