Former NHL goaltender Ray Emery died while swimming Sunday morning. He was 35 years old.

Don Brennan of the Ottawa Sun reported the news, noting Emery, who played for the Ottawa Senators, Chicago Blackhawks, Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Ducks during his NHL career, drowned Sunday morning at the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Hamilton Police provided an update on the situation Sunday afternoon:

"We responded along with Hamilton Fire and EMS. Unfortunately, our efforts on the water and in the area just around the piers were met with negative results."

Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas offered his condolences in a statement which read, in part, he was "fortunate to be around Ray at the very start of his promising career in Sault Ste. Marie, where we drafted him in 1999, and then again at the end of his carrer, when he played for us in 2016-17 with the Toronto Marlies:"
